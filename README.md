# Docs
There is no website offering documentation, however if you hover over a function in your IDE it will give you some info about what it does, you can also just read the source code. For an example in a discord bot, please click [here](https://github.com/Kile/pypxl/blob/main/examples/glitch_discord.markdown)

I have implemented most functions this library offers in commands in my bot. You can find those commands [here](https://github.com/Kile/Killua/blob/main/killua/cogs/pxlapi.py)
